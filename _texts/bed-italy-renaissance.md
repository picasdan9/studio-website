## Introduction

Traditionally, the art of Renaissance Italy is characterised as primarily driven by religion, mercantile success, and civic pride.[1] This narrative has been broadened by some relatively recent scholarly efforts that centre on hitherto unheeded perspectives, such as of the poor[2] and of the domestic interior,[3] the latter of which shall be the focus of this essay. Said studies are committed to the belief that unravelling the cultural and social values and practices imbued in the arts of the interior could provide a fuller re-imagining of this period.

I reckon that these academic endeavours generally regard the domestic interior as a category of space that demands greater attention, with the same conviction as for public and exterior sites like the church and the court. Furthermore, the treatment of the interior, albeit pluralistic, generally relates it to only one facet of the Renaissance life at a time; in cases where multiple aspects are brought together, they function via an associative or complementary logic, such as the link between devotion and marriage.[4] The aim of this essay is then to incorporate the interior as part of an evolving history of art that potentially finds a family of artworks as reactionary to prevailing social attitudes or artistic themes that precede them. I shall argue that paintings of the 15th-century Italian Renaissance conceive of the bourgeois interior as a sacred space, the moral status of which is then transgressed by the interiorised nude in 16th-century art.

This essay aims not to arrive at a generalisable trend in the history of Italian Renaissance art. Not only such a noble aspiration is necessarily hindered by the incomplete and fragmentary status of surviving artefacts, but I also only seek to suggest a possible reading specific to certain patronage of art that unquestionably resists a blanket generalisation. Additionally, this writing is undertaken with a consciousness of class stratification and hopes to read between the consumption of art within and across social classes. The first part of this essay argues for the devotional function of the bourgeois interior imposed with a religious moral order, typified by Fra Filippo Lippi’s painting _Annunciation_. This follows by demonstrating that the nude, exemplified by Titian’s _Venus of Urbino_, could be interpreted as transgressing the sacred bourgeois interior — a reading that is unique to an interiorised, “high art” subject precisely because of the value-laden connotation of this space.

## Interiorising religion

The reason for choosing the Annunciation, the event when archangel Gabriel announces to Virgin Mary that she would give birth to Jesus Christ, as the focus for this section is twofold. Firstly, towards the Renaissance, this displays a trend towards interiorisation in both theological interpretations[5] and correspondingly pictorial depictions.[6] Secondly, the relative abundance of surviving artefacts depicting the Annunciation[7] lends credence to any attempt at constructing a convincing interpretation of this period from a present-day standpoint.

In the Medieval Age, perhaps because a narrative painting often requires a larger scale that costs more than a smaller-size artefact bearing religious icons, paintings of the Annunciation reside mostly in churches. _Annunciation with St. Margaret and St. Ansanus by Martini and Memmi_ (fig. 1) is an example, an altarpiece commissioned for the Siena cathedral.[8] Without the tool of linear perspective that was only developed in the Renaissance, space appears flat; there is little depth as evident in the narrow floor contrasting with the wide, uniform background wall. Additionally, the spatial arrangements of objects and figures at times seem incoherent. The throne on the right of the painting appears to have a negligible width that does not seem to logically offer a comfortable seat for Mary, and her legs seem to protrude substantially to her left, a rather strange posture to be in. The strategies with which this painting engages with the viewer then remain largely with the materialistic inspiration resulted from the gold plating and intricate decorations, together with unmistakable religious iconography that is principally informational of biblical facts, such as the throne alluding to Mary’s title Queen of Heaven and the lilies in the middle symbolic of Mary’s purity.

Domestic devotion did not start with the Renaissance,[9] but only in the Renaissance did we begin to see a significant number of narrative paintings featured in private dwellings of wealthy merchant families, on top of customary domestic objects whose significance lies in primarily religious iconography, such as a miniature wooden Holy Cross. Fra Filippo Lippi’s painting _Annunciation_ (fig. 2), one among his many, shall illustrate how artistic techniques of the Renaissance enable a distinctive devotional functioning of such arts. The development of linear perspective enable space to be rendered faithfully and with an alluring depth. Furthermore, the believable sense of space extends devotional focus beyond the basal religious iconography and engages the domestic viewer psychologically: the event feels extremely close to where the viewer lives, as if the biblical event is not a remote occurrence but an event very contemporary. This is furthered by the inclusion of domestic objects — the vase, the bed, and the chest — whose details were depicted with contemporary accuracy that acquires even a documentary quality and realness to the original viewer.[10]

This blend between the biblical past, connoted by conventions of iconography, and the contemporary relatedness, expressed via faithful portrayal of domestic objects, sets Syson to advance an argument about a devotional practice realised by the logic of memory as understood at the time. He maintains that any object seen in the painting should not be read simply as either an imagined artefact of religious iconography or a real documented object, but as a potentially ambivalent image that invites the viewer to engage more deeply with the content of the painting. An example of this, from my reading of his text, is the golden textile canopy hung over the bed behind Mary. On the one hand, it follows the bed design in a Renaissance palace, as seen a present-day palazzo in Florence (fig. 3). On the other, the golden material implies that the hanging is in fact the throne of Mary but transformed into a more veiled form. To the original viewer, specifically a member of a merchant family, the image of the golden canopy, amid other more prominent details of the painting like the figures of Mary and Gabriel, might not necessarily register on the viewer’s active consciousness, but it could possibly enter the latent subconscious. As the viewer carries on with their day, the lingering image of the golden canopy might momentarily surface and act as a prompt to recall both the personal, empirical encounter with the painting and the collective memory of the biblical event. Of course, the memory prompt would often not be complete or coherent; the viewers might wonder what the golden canopy means and why it is part of the painting. But the process of asking and probing into the content of the painting is precisely the operative logic of this art: as the viewer chances upon the painting again during their busy day or intentionally examines it, they slowly uncover the biblical significance of even the most everyday object in the bourgeois Renaissance life. The example illustrates the humanist idea “memory palace”, where the painting contributes to a devotional mental realm that helps the believer recall religious facts.[11] The effect is that religious thought permeates all aspects everyday life in Renaissance Italy, from the public sites of cathedrals to the domestic realm of dwellings, and even the most private space of the mind.

The religious facts conveyed through the painting are not value-neutral but laden with moral claims. Sysoy highlights that the domestic realm of Renaissance Italy is particularly populated with images of Mary, particularly in the events of the Annunciation and the Nativity of Christ. These advance a loaded view about the role of women in the domestic realm: women are guardians of the household, women should uphold the virtues of purity and economic prudence, and women should observe the decorum regarding domestic behaviours.[12] These were in alignment with the prevailing attitudes of the society, reflected in the wealth of contemporary prescriptive literature that survive till the present day, as noted by Dennis.[13]

## Interiorising the nude as an act of transgression

The erotic subjects have always been a part of Medieval and Renaissance life, even before the revival of the Classic nudes; however, they were relegated to the category of “low art,” existing mostly in the forms of literary works and mass-produced woodcut prints,[14] as in the case of the book _Storia di due amanti_ accompanied by woodcut illustrations (fig. 4). Linear perspective is at work here to order the occupation of interior objects and characters in space in a believable manner, evident in the bed frames foreshortening and receding into the image plane. In contrast with the harmony and balance _Annunciation_ depicting two still figures of equal sizes placed on two sides of the painting, the illustrations of _Storia di due amanti_ feature a dynamic composition of a couple engaging sexual acts within a disorderly interior space.

Interests in the Classical antiquity bring the nude to the world of high art, but almost always in the context of appreciating the intrinsic beauty of athletic figures or as embodiment of the transcendental Greek Gods. Specifically, only the heavenly, being transcendental and possessing idealist virtues, can be represented nude, and the earthly must be clothed, in line with the prevailing moral decorum. This distinction, informed by Renaissance scholar Marsilio Ficino’s writings that shape the Neoplatonist currents of the period, is reflected in Titian’s _Sacred and Profane Love_ (fig. 5), where we see the heavenly, celestial, nude Venus on the right, and the earthly, fully clothed Venus on the left.[15][16] A Neoplatonist reading construes the nude as eliciting an appreciation for the embodied form of Venus, which would subsequently be elevated to the love for the virtues that the transcendental Venus symbolises — the intellectual love for spiritual beauty.

When we turn to Titian’s _Venus of Urbino_ (fig. 6), we see a single female depicted completely naked. As evident in the title, the figure is Venus portrayed in a seductive pose reminiscent of Hellenistic sculptures. The details given to the visualization of the interior is astonishing, with the chests and tapestries in the background, and even the inconspicuous draping around the bed located at the top left corner of the painting, bearing close resemblance to the actual bourgeois interior of the period.[17] The crumpled sheets on the bed share a formal similarity with the illustrations from _Storia di due amanti_, alluding to a possibility of sexual acts having taken place on the same bed.

![Figure 6. Titian, _Venus of Urbino_, Oil on canvas, 1538, Uffizi Gallery, https://www.uffizi.it/en/artworks/venus-urbino-titian](fig6.jpg)

Unlike _Sacred and Profane Love_, or even Giorgione’s _Sleeping Venus_ that inspires Venus of Urbino, the last work is set in a fully interior space. I opine that the faithful depiction of the bourgeois interior in Venus of Urbino necessarily implies that the occupants of the space belong to the mortal world, as opposed to the natural, exterior setting that witnesses the heavenly interface with the earthly. In this sense, the female nude in _Venus of Urbino_ would be read not so much as the Venus goddess, but instead as an earthly female inhabitant of a bourgeois dwelling. It is for this reason that the painting could be read as transgressing the sacred interior space. Neoplatonism perhaps would not be able to displace the eroticism with more virtuous values because the interior setting anchors the viewer in the earthly world and thus precludes any possible association with the elevated heavenly realm.

## Conclusion

15th-century Italian Renaissance paintings conjure up the bourgeois interior, specifically the bedroom, as a site of religious devotion ascribed with moral principles of the church. Religion could then be thought of as penetrating even the most private corners of the bourgeois Renaissance life. The reign of religious morality was subsequently compromised by the 16th-century interiorised female nude that transgresses the sacred interior space. The customary Neoplatonic thoughts that sought to displace profane eroticism with Classist idealism are rendered ineffectual precisely because the nude subject is read relative to the moralised interior of bourgeois mortals rather than the exterior as a site of the heavenly interfacing with mortal realm. Space, perceived, comprehended, and represented by human minds, turns out to not be as neutral and rational as hoped by the Renaissance project, but is inescapably imbued with subjective attitudes and values, a topic that would later make modern and contemporary architectural theorists and phenomenologists spill much ink over.

[16] Here I leverage on Adams’ interpretations presented that do not focus on the potentially misleading, falsely dichotomous title that was only attributed to the painting many years after it was created. I acknowledge that there are other interpretations that read the figure on the right as the bride that the painting was originally commissioned for. Nevertheless, I maintain that, as for many Renaissance images, a figure rarely uniquely identifies a person, but often is a subsumption of multiple identities. My identification of the clothed figure is thus not meant to be exclusionary, but merely an invocation of one identity among many that are attributed to this figure.
