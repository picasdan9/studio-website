## Context

Hwa Chong Institution Boarding School (HCIBS), designed by Kenzo Tange, is an on-campus residential complex opened in 2002, aimed to address the rising number of foreign students due to Singapore’s initiative in giving pre-tertiary and undergraduate scholarships to students from China and Southeast Asia since the 1990s (Yang, 2016). The work is perhaps the last token of Singapore’s adoption of the Japanese modernist paradigm through Tange’s leadership in efforts to rejuvenate the post-war urban landscape since the 1970s (Xue et Xiao, 2014).

The Japanese modernist qualities that imbue HCIBS render it a place of egalitarian living capable of providing spaces for individual subjectivities (Kurokawa, 1977), thus harmonizing rather than unifying a heterogenous body of boarders under the veneer of a common home. But far from a purely democratic ideal, Japanese modernism could potentially imply centralization of power due to the necessary aspect of social engineering in designing a ‘megastructure’ that houses a variety of social and personal functions (Tamari, 2014). In the case of HCIBS, living there entails a constant immersion in the physical manifestation of the institution. Its modernist architectural qualities of openness and visibility usher in the capacity for surveillance as a mechanism of reinforcing power relations (Jones, 1999).
At their extremes in an essentialist sense, these two facets of democracy and social control negate each other. In reality, they represent two opposing forces that shape HCIBS. This paper thus aims to unpack these dynamics and attempts to characterize the ontological and epistemological position of boarders as both the known object being observed and the knowing subject capable of observing as necessitated by the modernist architecture of HCIBS.

## Modernism in the 21st century

The boarding school lies uphill at the southwest end of the campus, effectively removed from the happenings of the main Bukit Timah Road at the Northeast, and the bustling activities permeating the rest of the campus (Fig. 1). Two routes lead one to the entrance of the complex: one external route from Namly Avenue, accessible from Bukit Timah Road, and an internal route from the High School section.

Gazing from the outside, one is instantaneously struck by the massive volumes of the residential blocks (Fig. 2). The façade is articulated by vertical and horizontal lines abstracted from window placement and louver screens. The non-uniformity in the spacing of these lines connotes a Mondrianesque rhythm that evokes the dynamism of modernity.

To enter, pedestrians take a narrow flight of open staircase of about ten metres in height to reach the security post. Entrance is granted to only registered boarders, their family members, and visitors with prescheduled appointments. The pedestrian route continues straight, going past the office on the left before penetrating the heart of the complex – a central open space surrounded by two rows residential blocks and the dining hall (Fig. 3). The two rows of residential blocks are arranged to converge at the far end of the complex at an angle of approximately twenty degrees. The small angle of convergence makes the two rows appear as if they are parallel and converge due to the perspective view (Fig. 4). This reminisces the Metabolist conception of a city corridor with linear megastructures on two sides to facilitate urban expansion (Maki, 1964).

Echoes of Le Corbusier’s Unité d'habitation can be found in the design of the residential blocks. This is evident in two aspects: the living volumes are raised above the ground by load-bearing columns (Fig. 4, 5), and the ground level houses common facilities – a gym, four music rooms, two study rooms, a function room, three laundry rooms. The open space at the ground level with no designated functions becomes a flexible avenue for communal activities, ranging from study sessions to barbecue nights.

The whole complex accommodates seven residential blocks, four on the long row facing the front entrance, three on the shorter side (Fig. 3). Each residential block comprises two square prismatic masses of residential rooms, connected by a middle core where two elevators and a study room at each level are located (Fig. 6). Each prismatic mass is hollow, with the corridor located inside, facing the internal hollow space (Fig. 7). Each level of a prismatic mass forms a cluster of six to seven rooms for student boarders and one flat for a teacher mentor’s family.

## A place of ambivalence

Taking a phenomenological approach, postmodern characteristics of HCIBS emerge, particularly with regards to the rejection of singularity and unity. Two binary dichotomies are disrupted: home and work, and the act of observing and the state of being observed.

Most boarders would refer to “going home” as going back to the boarding school. But when asked if HCIBS can be viewed as home, they all do not think that such an equation is justified. For many, a sense of belonging, whether to the community or to the place itself, is almost non-existent. This can be attributed to the large and heterogeneous nature of the boarder population, consisting of students from Secondary 1 to Junior College 2 primarily, and a few undergraduate students and teacher mentors. Activities that aim to foster communal bonds are largely targeted at the secondary school boarders, hence the failure of other residents to belong is inevitable. Some noted that while they have their little community in HCIBS, the basis for the social group is often not rooted in the place itself, but rather by other common grounds such as nationality or the fact that they go to the same class or co-curricular activities in school. In this aspect, HCIBS “reinforced the friendships formed outside the place itself, by harbouring memories of the things we do together,” said Huy, a 2018-2019 boarder.

This line of analysis can be extended to the sense of attachment to the physical space, or the lack thereof. Pallasmaa writes that built structures can act as a token for remembrance (Pallasmaa, 2007), but if no memories are formed, HCIBS is merely an empty box devoid of memorial content. Furthermore, certain living practices hinder the process of memory creation and the development of a sense of attachment. For instance, rearrangement of furniture inside the room and modification to walls are prohibited, and boarders are required to change their rooms every year. This results in an internal displacement that limits the capacity for differentiation and individualization of the lived space, either through interior design and/or decoration.

Nevertheless, HCIBS fulfils the role of being a protective shelter. The site is strategically removed from concentrated areas of transportation and work, thus offering a distinctive contrast. This fits within the historiographical narrative of the privatization of the Western home characterized by the separation of home and work (Madanipour, 2003). Furthermore, “HCIBS is like a fortress: outsiders cannot see what’s happening inside – including the internal structure of the compound,” commented Thien, a 2017-2018 boarder, on the façade of the complex. Additionally, a multitude of security checkpoints engenders selective permeability of the structure, ensuring that not only the outsider’s gaze but also his physical body cannot penetrate HCIBS.

However, once entering the place, one is subjected to endogenous surveillance, operating by the mechanism of visibility. Public spaces in HCIBS, such as the dining hall and the lift lobby, are clearly demarcated by glass walls (Fig. 8), enabling constant observation of boarders. Many find this deeply intrusive, especially when they are using the gym and the music room because of the feeling of “being judged by those passing by” (Isaac, a 2017-2019 boarder).

![Figure 8: View from inside the dining hall (Taken by the author)](Fig8.jpg)

At each residential cluster, the hollow square shape with the corridor lining the inside permits total visibility of anyone strolling along the corridor (Fig. 9). He or she is seen not only by people from the same cluster but also by those from below and above levels (Fig. 10), even those from the ground floor (Fig. 7). Nonetheless, the location of the cluster corridor being internal and the louver screen on the external façade effectively blocks the gaze from outside the cluster. This reinforces the working of endogenous surveillance within a single building block. Sentiments regarding the state of being observed within a residential cluster have been mixed: while for some this has little influence over how they behave as a cluster is often constituted by a largely homogenous demographic in terms of age and/or the school they come from, others claim that visibility necessarily places them in a position of constantly receiving judgements.

![Figure 10: View of below clusters (Taken by the author)](Fig10.jpg)

This mode of endogenous surveillance through visibility necessarily gives way to the enforcement of the behavioural code. To illustrate, I shall quote what is said by a boarder when asked about her opinion on surveillance in HCIBS.

“My cluster mentor has the habit of entering our rooms at 10:20 pm to take attendance every night. […] If I am using the Internet to do anything that isn’t remotely close to studies (watching Youtube videos), I would switch the tabs.

[…] We keep the door open in the morning. I don’t want people to know my online activity. But I feel that the other people living in the cluster may be aware of my online activity since I may be overly engrossed in consuming content so my act of switching tabs may be self-justificatory.

I’m slowly getting used to the fact that nothing is private in the boarding school anymore. The fact that rooms have limited access to wifi is rather troubling since the places that provide access to wifi are open and shared. The immediate implication is someone can see what you’re browsing if you’re using the Internet in the study room.” (Zhun Lyn, a 2018-2019 boarder)

It should be noted that the visibility as described above is two-way: instances of being observed (Fig. 11) and of observing (Fig. 12) are reciprocal. But on top of that, there is one-way visibility at work. The residential rooms are raised above the ground, thus positioned at a vantage point capable of looking out. But unlike Corbusier’s Villa Savoye that also permits a reciprocal gaze (Jones, 1999), the view from outside looking in for HCIBS rooms is disrupted by the louver screen, thus rendering the residential room a unidirectional observatory. The residential room becomes the most private space for most boarders. This is not immensely undermined by room sharing, for boarders of similar ages are often grouped together, and they also have the option to choose their roommates. Minh, a 2016-2017 boarder, shared with me that, “Although I have to share [my room] with two other people, it’s OUR private space.” For some, it even offers a sense of freedom that is absent when living with parents: “[…] staying in boarding school allows me to do things that are impossible with parental supervision,” said Zhun Lyn. Outside the purview of surveillance and as a space of social comfort, the residential room can thus be regarded as a shelter for individual subjectivity.

## Double consciousness

The interplay of architectural forms and behavioural practices within HCIBS in shaping boarders’ lived experience and, by extension, HCIBS itself invites a materialist analysis (DeLanda, 2010). Specifically, recognising that an essentialist account would fail to accommodate the contradictory ontological positions of a boarder as both a subject capable of observing and an object under surveillance, and the opposing capacities for individual subjectivity and collective egalitarianism, I wish to invoke DeLanda’s assemblage theory as my analytical lens to see these antagonistic tendencies as interconnected components within a social phenomenon.

Following Deleuze, DeLanda posits “relations of exteriority” as a key characteristic of an assemblage: autonomous components making up an assemblage determine its properties not through the aggregation of the constituent properties but rather through mutual interaction between parts (DeLanda, 2006). This resonates well in the case of HCIBS, for the architectural design, the boarding school staff, and the boarder population are largely independent, but their interaction limits one another’s potentialities and consequently shapes what the boarding school is.

Additionally, DeLanda situates an assemblage along two axes: the material-expressive and territorialization-deterritorialization dimensions (DeLanda, 2006). The material components of HCIBS relevant in this discussion comprise the human bodies of the boarding school staff as an institutional organization, those of the boarders, and the structure of the complex; meanwhile, the expressive components at focus are demonstrated by authoritative or acquiescent behaviours of the according bodies, and the architectural qualities of the buildings (DeLanda, 2006). The interaction and exercised capacities of these components shall facilitate the processes of territorialization – to stabilize, homogenize, and hierarchize – and deterritorialization – to destabilize, heterogenize, and subvert – that constitute the boarding school.

At the macro level, the modernisation of architectural forms plays a crucial territorializing role. The championing of the Japanese modernist paradigm sets HCIBS distinct from and oblivious of the colonial architecture of the rest of campus as designed by Swan & Maclaren, a pioneer firm in Singapore (Tan, 2013). A relevant parallelism can be drawn from Lilian Chee’s writing on Singapore’s public housing that reads modernist “utopia” as both an “ideal place” and “no place” (Chee, 2010). Just like the state’s inadvertent erasure of the kampung in pursuing the modernist egalitarianism in public housing, HCIBS bears no traces of regionalism. This is in line with the aim to house a heterogenous boarder population at the cost of homogeneity and ahistoricism: boarders of various races and nationalities have no choice but to drop their cultural particularities upon coming to live in HCIBS.

Surveillance is another primary means of territorialisation, the mechanism of which has been articulated by Foucault on the discussion of Bentham’s panopticon prison. The residential block best demonstrates the resemblance, evident in the visibility of boarders around an observer in the hollow middle. But the manifestation of the panopticon prison needs not be taken literally. Rather, the mechanism of visibility governing the functioning of the Panopticon is at work, enabling constant surveillance in HCIBS. For one, the open plan on the ground floor facilitates instantaneous seeing of boarders engaging in various activities - hanging out at the benches or walking to and fro the common facilities. Additionally, the use of glass visually exposes the happenings inside a physically demarcated space to an observer outside.

The disciplinary nature of the boarding school being capable of punishing boarders for wrongful behaviours is the basis for the operation of the Panopticon. Individuals in the position of authority – boarding school administrative staff, security guards, teacher mentors – rely on the visibility of the boarders to look out for deviant behaviours and subsequently regulate them through disciplinary actions. Boarders, aware of their visibility, consciously self-monitor and self-regulate their own actions, lest they are seen and punished. In effect, vertical power relations are sustained and boarders’ behaviours are standardized and homogenized.

But it would be misguided to reduce HCIBS to merely the panopticon prison. The boarding school staff, instead of occupying the centre of the Panopticon with a totalizing view and appearing invisible to the monitored objects, is displaced: they are also fully visible to the population of boarders. This characteristic recalls Mathiesen’s notion of Synopticon, where the few boarding school staff are now seen by the many boarders (Mathiesen, 1997). The connotative significance of authority embodied by them multiplies at every instance of seeing, further entrenching the power structure permeating the boarding school.

Besides the case for vertical power relations, the aspect of visibility also implicates the horizontal plane. The aforementioned mechanisms of visibility and room sharing annihilate any opportunity for boarders to stand outside the gaze of their peers. For most, this gaze is homogenizing in nature. The fear of peers’ judgement diminishes the confidence in idiosyncratic self-expression. Nevertheless, in rarer cases where boarders are able to find a small community that they belong to in HCIBS, perhaps individual subjectivity can be accommodated for, especially when rooms are shared with close friends rather than strangers.

While visibility facilitates the process of territorialisation via surveillance, it is also the operating mechanism for deterritorialization by situating boarders in the active position of a knower. I argue that the residential rooms are private spaces that shelter individual subjectivities. The capacity of the residential rooms to not be seen from the cluster or from outside the windows disrupts the continuity of surveillance, offering an avenue for individual peculiarity. Furthermore, the study room at every level of the residential block as a designated space of work allows the residential rooms to be the antithesis, hence truly private (Riley, 1999).

Despite regular room checks by boarding school staff and restrictions on what can be done to the rooms, the one-way visibility enables boarders to anticipate the coming of boarding school staff and thus be able to avoid having their idiosyncratic expression be monitored and regulated. Without the penetrating vision, boarding school staff have to physically go to the rooms for inspection. Sensory clues such as footsteps, or a glance out of the room, suffice to signal the impending gaze. This piece of knowledge allows boarders to have the time to present themselves in a manner following the code of conduct. In a way, boarders subvert the ideological apparatus of the spectacle: that their being is reduced to appearances (Debord, 1977) seen by surveillance (Welsh, 2010) enables them to conceal deviant undercurrents beneath a disciplined front.

## Conclusion

The double consciousness of HCIBS boarders is a necessary consequence of modernism’s conflicting qualities of democracy and social control, and of egalitarianism and individual idiosyncrasies. The visibility articulated by the open plan and glass renders the boarding school a panopticon capable of constant surveillance, positioning boarders as passive objects to be known. Self-monitoring and self-regulation of behaviours, consequently, assimilates boarders into a homogenous population. At the same time, the residential rooms, shielded from the gaze of surveillance, are spaces of privacy and individual subjectivity that place boarders in the active standpoint of an observer, and by extension, a knower. Some extent of freedom is exercised, where idiosyncrasies are discreetly and safely expressed, as long as they remain strictly outside the realm of surveillance.

A reversal of power relations would arguably never be achieved. But perhaps an attitude of veiled irreverence is what it takes to stay true to one’s idiosyncrasies in this stifling surveillance society.
