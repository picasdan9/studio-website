It is the 15th in the Lunar Calendar. Gazing upon the night sky, I never fail to be astonished by the familiar sight of the moon. It's uncanny even, to feel myself in a momentary escape from the territories of Singapore, to be transported to where my mind longs for.

How many full-moons have passed since I was last home?

Many international students, myself included, have been stranded in Singapore because of the pandemic. We stay connected to home, or at least try to, in thoughts and through digital images. In this respect, they are at once tokens of memories and an interface for continued contact with home.

I use projection as an attempt to embody the subjects' relations with their photos. With images blown to life-size, a new modality to access and interact with home emerges. What ensues is perhaps not magnification, but recognition of our longing for home.
